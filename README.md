## Introduction
The mechanisms by which transcriptional activation domains (tADs) initiate eukaryotic gene expression have been an enigma for decades because most tADs lack specificity in sequence, structure, and interactions with targets. Machine learning analyses of in vivo generated sequence datasets revealed that highly variable tAD sequences are characterized by the preferred near-terminal location of the aromatic extremity and internal positions of acidic residues. The abundance of both aromatic and acidic amino acids in the tAD greatly increases the functionality. tADs likely affect the gene promoter chromatin environment, functioning as nucleosome surfactants rather than as recruiters of coactivators. This mechanism is based on near-noise levels of molecular interactions, which are not usually considered important for function and are thus overlooked by conventional biochemistry. This bioinformatics analysis contributes to the development of a liquid-liquid phase separation model and can be seminal for the biochemistry field of near-stochastic functional allosteric interactions.
